# Computing and Data Science Masters Project
Work done at university
This is my master's project. A sample input data is provided.
Your computer must have Esri's ArcMap, preferably v10.7, installed.
Change the name of the input file and workspace location, then run the program.
Will result in the creation of the areas of greatest overlap of circular buffers, with each area of overlap being removed from available overlap areas once selected.
Open the baseTop and appBuff shapefiles in a GIS to see the results
